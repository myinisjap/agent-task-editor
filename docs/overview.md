# Agent Task Editor — Overview

Agent Task Editor is a self-hosted Kanban-style task board where AI agents automatically work through tasks as they move across workflow columns. You define the workflow, assign AI agents to specific columns, and the system dispatches, runs, and tracks every agent invocation against your code repositories.

## Core Concepts

### Tasks
A task is the unit of work — it has a title, a description, a type (e.g. `feature`, `bug`, `chore`), and a **label** that represents its current position in the workflow. Tasks are always associated with a repository and a workflow.

Additional task fields:
- `branch` — the git branch provisioned for this task (`ate-<slug>-<id>`)
- `worktree_path` — path to the per-task git worktree (empty if not yet provisioned or already torn down)
- `base_ref` — the ref the branch was forked from (used for diff computation)
- `agent_notes` — persistent markdown notes written by agents across runs; injected into each new run's prompt
- `source` / `source_ref` — where the task was imported from (`github` / `owner/repo#123`); empty for manually created tasks (see [task-sources.md](task-sources.md))

### Workflows
A workflow is a directed state machine composed of **labels** (columns) and **transitions** (allowed moves between them). Each transition has a `trigger_type`:

- `agent` — an AI agent may execute this transition automatically
- `human` — only a human clicking Approve/Reject in the UI may execute it
- `both` — either can trigger it

Labels carry flags:
- `agent_ignore` — agents may not send tasks here (useful for parking spots like `not_ready`)
- `is_terminal` — the task is finished; no further transitions apply (e.g. `done`)

Human-gated transitions carry a `path` (`success` or `failure`); Approve follows `success` and Reject follows `failure`.

### Default Workflow
The server seeds a default workflow on first run:

```
not_ready → plan → review-plan → work → testing → agent-review → review → done
```

Key behaviour:
- `not_ready → plan` requires human approval
- `plan → review-plan` is agent-triggered (dispatch kicks off automatically)
- `review-plan → work` (approved) and `review-plan → plan` (rejected) require human approval
- `review → done` (approved) and `review → work` (rejected) require human approval
- Feedback loops exist: `testing`, `agent-review`, and `review` can all move a task back to `work` on failure
- `not_ready` has `agent_ignore = true` — nothing runs while a task is parked there, and no transition routes back into it automatically

### Agent Configs
An agent config binds a set of labels to a specific AI provider with its settings (model, system prompt, token limits, timeout, extra env vars). When the dispatcher finds a task on one of those labels it creates an agent run using that config.

### Repositories
A repository is a local directory path registered in the system. Agents run with their working directory set to the repo path. Optionally, `REPO_BASE_DIR` restricts which paths can be registered.

### Git Worktrees
Each task gets its own git branch (`ate-<slug>-<id>`) provisioned in a separate git worktree the first time an agent is dispatched. This means:
- Concurrent agents working on the same repo don't conflict with each other
- Each agent has a clean, isolated view of the codebase
- When a task reaches a terminal label, the worktree is torn down (branch is preserved for PR review)

### Agent Notes
Tasks carry an `agent_notes` field — persistent markdown that agents write via `update_task_notes`. Notes survive across multiple runs and are injected at the top of each new run's prompt under `"NOTES FROM PRIOR AGENT:"`. This is how agents in a multi-step workflow hand off context to each other.

### Run Stored Info
Agents can call `store_info` to persist a summary of what they did. This content is stored in the agent run record and displayed in the task detail view in the UI after the run completes. Unlike `agent_notes` (which carry forward to the next agent), stored info is per-run.

### Agent Runs
Each time an agent is dispatched for a task, an **agent run** record is created. Runs have statuses: `pending → running → completed | failed | waiting_human`. Live stdout/tool call output is streamed over WebSocket and persisted to the database for replay on reconnect.

                                          │ LLMRunner         │ (OpenAI-compat)
                                          └──────────────────┘
```

The dispatcher polls the database every 5 seconds for tasks whose label matches an agent config. It creates a run record, marks the task's `active_agent_run_id`, and submits the job to the bounded worker pool. The pool streams logs to the WebSocket hub as they arrive and persists them to SQLite in batched transactions.

## Features at a Glance

- **Kanban board** with drag-and-drop between columns
- **Live log streaming** — agent stdout, tool calls, and tool results streamed in real time
- **Log replay** — reconnecting clients receive all prior logs for the current run
- **Per-task git worktrees** — concurrent agents on the same repo don't conflict
- **One-click PR URL** — pre-filled GitHub compare URL with task description and agent notes
- **Workflow editor** — create/edit labels, transitions, trigger types; import/export YAML
- **Agent config UI** — manage multiple AI configs each targeting different workflow stages
- **Git diff viewer** — per-task branch diff against the base ref
- **Session resume** — re-runs on the same task continue the agent's previous
  conversation (`claude --resume`) with full prior context instead of starting
  cold; per-agent-config opt-out for stages that want fresh eyes
- **Reply to a waiting agent** — when an agent asks for help (`request_human`),
  answer with text and it continues in the same session, without moving the task
- **Inline diff review comments** — leave file/line-anchored comments on the diff; open comments are injected into every agent run's prompt until the agent resolves them via the `resolve_comment` MCP tool (resolutions show up threaded in the diff viewer)
- **File upload attachments** — attach images to tasks; passed to the `claude` provider via `--image`
- **GitHub PR state sync** — auto-sync task git state with GitHub PR state; once
  a PR is detected as merged, the task's local branch (and any leftover
  worktree) are automatically cleaned up (remote branches are left untouched)
- **GitHub Issues import** — per repo, opt-in: open issues (optionally filtered
  by a label like `agent-ok`) are periodically imported as tasks, with a link
  back to the issue and dedupe on re-sweeps — see
  [task-sources.md](task-sources.md)
- **Dashboard** — split across three pages: an Overview (label counts, active agents, and the human intervention queue) at `/`, a Cost & Usage page at `/dashboard/usage` (Claude rate-limit usage, plus cost/token tracking by provider, day, and task), and an Agent Performance page at `/dashboard/performance` (per-agent-config success rate, duration, retries)
- **Provider health page** — readiness checks for the Claude/Qwen/Gemini/Codex CLIs, MCP sidecar, GitHub auth, and repo base directory
- **Bearer token auth** — optional `API_TOKEN`, or multiple named tokens via `API_TOKENS` so human-triggered transitions (approve/reject/move label) record *who* performed them in the `task_label_history` audit trail (`GET /tasks/{id}/label-history`); WebSocket auth via `?token=` query param
- **Docker Compose deployment** — single `docker compose up` to run everything

<!--
  NOTE: this screenshot predates the dashboard split into Overview /
  Cost & Usage / Performance pages and now only represents the Overview
  page (label counts, active agents, intervention queue). It no longer
  shows the cost/usage or per-agent-config performance tables, which moved
  to /dashboard/usage and /dashboard/performance respectively. Refreshing
  this screenshot, and adding new ones for the Cost & Usage and Agent
  Performance pages, is a nice-to-have follow-up per docs/screenshots.md
  (requires a clean seeded DB with some run history); not blocking for
  this change.
