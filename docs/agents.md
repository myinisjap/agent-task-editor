# Agents

## Agent Configs

An agent config connects a set of workflow labels to a specific AI provider. The dispatcher matches tasks to configs by label name.

### Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Human-readable name |
| `provider` | Provider string — see [Providers](#providers) below |
| `model` | Model identifier (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-4o`) |
| `labels` | JSON array of label names this agent handles (e.g. `["plan","work"]`) |
| `system_prompt` | Custom system instructions; appended with MCP tool guidance automatically |
| `max_tokens` | Maximum tokens per response (0 = provider default) |
| `timeout_secs` | Maximum run duration in seconds (0 = 600s default) |
| `max_turns` | Maximum agent turns/tool-call iterations per run (0 = 50 default) |
| `env` | JSON object of additional environment variables for the agent process |
| `enabled_plugins` | JSON array of Claude plugin IDs (`"<name>@<marketplace>"`) enabled for this config. **`claude` provider only.** Defaults to `[]` (all off). See [Claude Plugins & MCP Servers](#claude-plugins--mcp-servers) below. |
| `enabled_mcp_servers` | JSON array of Claude user-level MCP server names enabled for this config. **`claude` provider only.** Defaults to `[]` (all off). See [Claude Plugins & MCP Servers](#claude-plugins--mcp-servers) below. |

## Providers

| Provider string | Description | MCP Tools | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Claude CLI subprocess (`claude -p ...`) | ✅ All 5 | [providers/claude.md](providers/claude.md) |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Messages API (direct HTTP) | ❌ Native tools | [providers/anthropic.md](providers/anthropic.md) |
| `opencode` | Opencode CLI (`opencode run --format json`) | ❌ None | [providers/opencode.md](providers/opencode.md) |
| `qwen_code` | Qwen Code CLI (`qwen -p ...`) | ✅ All 5 | [providers/qwen_code.md](providers/qwen_code.md) |
| _(any other value)_ | OpenAI-compatible API at `LLM_BASE_URL` | ❌ Native tools | [providers/llm.md](providers/llm.md) |

## Dispatcher

The dispatcher runs a background goroutine that sweeps the database every 5 seconds:

1. Queries `ListAgentPickupTasks` — tasks whose label appears in any agent-triggerable transition AND whose `active_agent_run_id IS NULL`.
2. Loads all agent configs, matches each task to the first config whose `labels` array contains the task's label.
3. Creates an `agent_runs` record with status `pending`.
4. Sets the task's `active_agent_run_id` (and updates `current_agent_run_id`) — this prevents the next sweep from double-dispatching.
5. Submits a `Job` to the worker pool. If the pool queue is full, marks the run `failed` and clears `active_agent_run_id`.

## Worker Pool

The pool manages `MAX_WORKERS` concurrent goroutines (default 5). Each worker:

1. Sets the run status to `running`.
2. Calls `Provider.Run()` which streams `LogEntry` values on a channel.
3. Persists log entries to `agent_logs` in batched transactions (flush every 500ms or every 50 entries).
4. Simultaneously publishes each entry to the WebSocket hub for live streaming.
5. On completion, sets the run status to `completed`, `failed`, or `waiting_human`.
6. For `completed`/`failed`, clears `active_agent_run_id` so the dispatcher can re-pick-up the task.
7. For `waiting_human`, leaves `active_agent_run_id` set — dispatch is blocked until a human approves or rejects.

## Run Lifecycle

```
created (pending)
    │
    ▼ worker picks up
running
    │
    ├─▶ completed  → engine.Transition(nextLabel)  → active_run cleared
    ├─▶ failed                                      → active_run cleared
    └─▶ waiting_human → task.needs_human WS event  → active_run stays set
                            │
                    human approves/rejects
                            │
                    engine.Transition()              → active_run cleared
```

## Log Entry Types

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `system` | Internal messages (process start, timeout, exit) |
| `stdout` | Agent text output / parsed assistant messages |
| `stderr` | Stderr from the subprocess |
| `tool_call` | Tool invocation (Edit, Bash, signal_complete, etc.) |
| `tool_result` | Result returned to the agent after a tool call |

## Prompt Construction

The user prompt sent to the agent is assembled as:

```
[FEEDBACK FROM PRIOR REVIEW:
<feedback from the previous run, if any>

---]

[NOTES FROM PRIOR AGENT:
<agent_notes from the task, if any>

---]

Task: <title>

<description>

[ATTACHED IMAGES (available in .task_attachments/ within the repo):
- .task_attachments/<filename>
...]
```

The `"NOTES FROM PRIOR AGENT:"` section contains the task's `agent_notes` field — content that prior agents wrote via `update_task_notes`. This is the primary handoff mechanism between agents in a multi-step workflow.

### System Prompt Construction

The system prompt is the agent config's `system_prompt` field (defaults to a generic software engineer instruction if empty), with the following always appended:

1. **Repo path injection:** `"The repository you are working on is located at: <path>"`
2. **Notes handling instruction:** tells the agent to read the NOTES FROM PRIOR AGENT section carefully
3. **Notes writing instruction:** tells the agent to call `update_task_notes` before `signal_complete`, using `append:true` if prior notes were present
4. **Completion instruction:** `"When your work is complete, call the mcp__task-editor__signal_complete tool with outcome='success' if the work succeeded or outcome='failure' if it did not. If the MCP tool is unavailable, end your final response with exactly: OUTCOME: success  or  OUTCOME: failure"`

## MCP Tools (claude and qwen_code providers)

When `MCP_SERVER_PATH` is set, the `claude` and `qwen_code` providers launch an MCP sidecar that exposes 5 tools:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_task_transitions` | Call first — returns available transitions for the current label |
| `signal_complete(outcome, summary)` | Mark the run done; outcome must be `"success"` or `"failure"` |
| `request_human(message)` | Pause for human input |
| `update_task_notes(notes, append?)` | Write notes for subsequent agents |
| `store_info(info)` | Store run summary visible in the task UI |

See [mcp-tools.md](mcp-tools.md) for the full tool reference including parameters, return values, and behaviour details.

## Claude Plugins & MCP Servers

For the `claude` provider only, each agent config can select which Claude Code plugins and user-level MCP servers are enabled for its runs. **Everything defaults to off** — nothing is enabled unless explicitly selected.

- **Discovery source:** options are read dynamically from the server's own Claude home directory, not hardcoded:
  - Plugins: `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (the `plugins` object's keys, `"<name>@<marketplace>"`).
  - MCP servers: the **global/user-level** `mcpServers` key in `~/.claude.json`. Project-scoped servers under `projects["<path>"].mcpServers` are **not** included — only servers configured at the user level.
- **API:** `GET /agents/claude-options` returns the currently discovered `{ plugins: [{id, name, marketplace}], mcp_servers: [name] }` for the frontend to render as selection chips.
- **Enforcement at run time (`claude.go`):**
  - Plugins: the `claude` CLI is invoked with `--settings '{"enabledPlugins": {...}}'`, built by defaulting every discovered plugin to `false` and then setting `true` only for IDs present in `enabled_plugins`. A plugin selected but not present in the current discovery snapshot is still explicitly enabled (stale-inventory fallback).
  - MCP servers: for each name in `enabled_mcp_servers` (skipping the reserved `task-editor` name), its raw config entry is read from `~/.claude.json`'s global `mcpServers` map and merged into the `--mcp-config` file alongside the task-editor sidecar entry. A bare `mcp__<server>` entry is appended to `--allowedTools` per selected server so its tools aren't blocked — this wildcarding behavior is inferred from CLI docs and worth re-verifying against a live run if MCP tool calls are unexpectedly denied.
- **Scope:** this is currently `claude`-provider-only. Other providers (`anthropic`, `opencode`, `qwen_code`, generic `llm`) have the same DB columns available but ignore them entirely.

## Environment Variable Security

The `env` field in agent configs passes additional env vars to the subprocess. Keys that could hijack process execution are blocked and logged as warnings:

`PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `HOME`, `SHELL`, `IFS`, `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`
